  <h2>About the Colorado Data Science Team</h2>
  <p>Join the new club (and 1â€“credit course) which will represent CU Boulder in machine learning competitions as seen on Kaggle and other platforms. Come to our first official meeting on <b>Friday, August 26 at 5:00pm in ECCR 151</b>, to discuss the logistics, the goals, the scope, the leadership, the structure, and just to get involved. This will be an incredible opportunity to get hands-on experience applying modern machine learning tools to real problems with real data, not to mention a lot of fun (and maybe even $).</p>
