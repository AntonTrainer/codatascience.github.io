  <h2>Announcing the Colorado Data Science Team!</h2>
  <p>
Join the new club (and optional 1â€“credit course) which will
represent CU Boulder in machine learning competitions
as seen on <a href="http://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> and other platforms. Come to our first
official meeting on <b>Friday, August 26</b> at <b>5:00pm</b> in
<b>ECCR 151</b>, to discuss the logistics, goals, scope, leadership, structure, and just to get involved.
Food will be provided.
This will be an incredible opportunity to get hands-on
experience applying modern machine learning tools to
real problems with real data, not to mention a lot of fun
(and maybe even $).
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, interested students will have a strong background in computer science, mathematics, and/or statistics, but all students are welcome to join.
  We will hold weekly meetings, with status updates on competitions as well as tutorials and other opportunities to learn the tools of the trade from your peers.
