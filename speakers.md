title: Meet a Data Scientist
---

# Meet a Data Scientist (MADS) Series

* Every meeting (Tuesdays @ 5pm), we begin by hearing from a practicing data scientist or data science researcher.
* Talks are usually 10-15 minutes, and give students a glimpse of the breadth of data science in practice, beyond classroom projects and competitions, and the diversity in the types of data, techniques, and applications.
* Researchers often share the techniques they are developing, or how they use existing techniques to advance scientific knowledge; practicing data scientists often share the techniques and algorithms that they find to be most useful in their work, and their experiences about what works and when it works.
* Talks are typically aimed toward beginner and intermediate students, though some technical details are welcome for the more advanced MS and PhD students.
* While speakers are not expected to stay for our whole meeting, they usually stay for a few minutes after the talk, to answer questions and exchange contact information with interested students.
* Aside from keeping team members informed about their options after they graduate from CU, these talks also foster relationships with local data scientists which we hope will continue to grow.


If you are a data scientist (broadly construed) and believe a presentation on your current work would be a good fit for the Colorado Data Science Team, please reach out to the leadership team at codata@colorado.edu.
