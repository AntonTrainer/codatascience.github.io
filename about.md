The Colorado Data Science Team is a team of data scientists, machine learners, number crunchers, and statisticians at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/).  Our primary goal is educational: to get hands on experience working in teams applying modern machine learning tools to real problems with real data.  As part of this goal, we compete in internal prediction challenges, as well as representing CU Boulder in global competitions as seen on [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com), [DrivenData](http://www.drivendata.org/), [Quantopian](http://www.quantopian.com/), and other platforms.

Stay tuned for more information, and please **[sign up](https://goo.gl/forms/7VrM8xuJEYxKUYeB3)** for the team.
